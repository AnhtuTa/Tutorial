today is 11/6/2018, I woke up at 5h30 in the morning. After went to pee, dressed up, I leave home at 5h40 to go to work. I arrived bus stop at 5h50, and wait for the bus coming! At 5h55, It still didn't show up, show I have to called my mom to went to the bus stop with me and picked me up to Van Quan. But after that call, the bus number 39 finally showed up at 5h58, and I have to called my mom again to canceled the drive, I went to Van Quan by bus alone, so she didn't need to pick me up anymore!
